\description{
Bundles a data frame with its R markdown reference and caption
and file name for saving on the disc.
}
\details{
Technically, a data frame with label, ref_name
and caption attributes.
The mdtable inherits from data frame most of its methods.
ref_name: needs to be a valid markdown/bookdown reference name. By
default, spaces, slashes and underscores are silently turned into '-'.
You may easily insert the read-to-use table object code chunk into your
Rmarkdown document with the `insert()` method or reference it in the text
by calling `refer()`.
