\item{x}{an expression.}

\item{ref_name}{name of the reference to the code block,

no implementation in bookdown
(https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/238)}

}
\description{
Generates an mdexpression object which bundles an R expression
with its evaluation result and enables seamless insertion
into an R markdown document.
}
\details{
Throws any errors and warnings encountered during the evaluation.
In addition checks if the result is NULL, NA or Inf and raises a warning
if this is the case.
You may easily insert the read-to-use R code chunk stored in the mdexpr
object into your Rmarkdown document with the `insert()` or `refer()` method.

ref_name: needs to be a valid markdown/bookdown reference name. By
default, spaces, slashes and underscores are silently turned into '-'.
