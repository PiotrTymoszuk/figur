abstract = {PURPOSE Under common therapeutic regimens, the prognosis of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive squamous oropharyngeal carcinomas (OPCs) is more favorable than HPV-negative OPCs. However, the prognosis of some tumors is dismal, and validated prognostic factors are missing in clinical practice. The present work aimed to validate the prognostic significance of our published three-cluster model and to compare its prognostic value with those of the 8 th edition of the tumor-node-metastasis staging system (TNM8) and published signatures and clustering models. METHODS Patients with HPV DNA-positive OPCs with locoregionally advanced nonmetastatic disease treated with curative intent (BD2Decide observational study, NCT02832102) were considered as validation cohort. Patients were treated in seven European centers, with expertise in the multidisciplinary management of patients with head and neck cancer. The median follow-up was 46.2 months (95% CI, 41.2 to 50), and data collection was concluded in September 2019. The primary end point of this study was overall survival (OS). Three-clustering models and seven prognostic signatures were compared with our three-cluster model. RESULTS The study population consisted of 235 patients. The three-cluster model confirmed its prognostic value. Two-year OS in each cluster was 100% in the low-risk cluster, 96.6% in the intermediate-risk cluster, and 86.3% in the high-risk cluster (P = .00074). For the high-risk cluster, we observed an area under the curve = 0.832 for 2-year OS, significantly outperforming TNM 8th edition (area under the curve = 0.596), and functional and biological differences were identified for each cluster. CONCLUSION The rigorous clinical selection of the cases included in this study confirmed the robustness of our three-cluster model in HPV-positive OPCs. The prognostic value was found to be independent and superior compared with TNM8. The next step includes the translation of the three-cluster model in clinical practice. This could open the way to future exploration of already available therapies in HPV-positive OPCs tailoring de-escalation or intensification according to the three-cluster model.},

abstract = {Background: Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a common malignant tumor of the head and neck. LSCC patients have seriously impaired vocal, respiratory, and swallowing functions with poor prognosis. Circular RNA (circRNA) has attracted great attention in cancer research. However, the expression patterns and roles of circRNAs in LSCC remain largely unknown. Methods: RNA sequencing was performed on 57 pairs of LSCC and matched adjacent normal mucosa tissues to construct circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression profiles. RT-PCR, qPCR, Sanger sequencing, and FISH were undertaken to study the expression, localization, and clinical significance of circCORO1C in LSCC tissues and cells. The functions of circCORO1C in LSCC were investigated by RNAi-mediated knockdown, proliferation analysis, EdU staining, colony formation assay, Transwell assay, and apoptosis analysis. The regulatory mechanisms among circCORO1C, let-7c-5p, and PBX3 were investigated by luciferase assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results: circCORO1C was highly expressed in LSCC tissues and cells, and this high expression was closely associated with the malignant progression and poor prognosis of LSCC. Knockdown of circCORO1C inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenesis of LSCC cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that circCORO1C competitively bound to let-7c-5p and prevented it from decreasing the level of PBX3, which promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and finally facilitated the malignant progression of LSCC. Conclusions: circCORO1C has an oncogenic role in LSCC progression and may serve as a novel target for LSCC therapy. circCORO1C expression has the potential to serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for LSCC detection.},

abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. Thirty percent of patients will experience locoregional recurrence for which median survival is less than 1 year. Factors contributing to treatment failure include inherent resistance to X-rays and chemotherapy, hypoxia, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and immune suppression. The unique properties of 12C radiotherapy including enhanced cell killing, a decreased oxygen enhancement ratio, generation of complex DNA damage, and the potential to overcome immune suppression make its application well suited to the treatment of HNSCC. We examined the 12C radioresponse of five HNSCC cell lines, whose surviving fraction at 3.5 Gy ranged from average to resistant when compared with a larger panel of 38 cell lines to determine if 12C irradiation can overcome X-ray radioresistance and to identify biomarkers predictive of 12C radioresponse. Cells were irradiated with 12C using a SOBP with an average LET of 80 keV/$\mu$m (CNAO: Pavia, Italy). RBE values varied depending upon endpoint used. A 37 gene signature was able to place cells in their respective radiosensitivity cohort with an accuracy of 86%. Radioresistant cells were characterized by an enrichment of genes associated with radioresistance and survival mechanisms including but not limited to G2/M Checkpoint MTORC1, HIF1$\alpha$, and PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling. These data were used in conjunction with an in silico-based modeling approach to evaluate tumor control probability after 12C irradiation that compared clinically used treatment schedules with fixed RBE values vs. the RBEs determined for each cell line. Based on the above analysis, we present the framework of a strategy to utilize biological markers to predict which HNSCC patients would benefit the most from 12C radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Stratification of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) based on HPV16 DNA and RNA status, gene expression patterns, and mutated candidate genes may facilitate patient treatment decision. We characterize head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with different HPV16 DNA and RNA (E6∗I) status from 290 consecutively recruited patients by gene expression profiling and targeted sequencing of 50 genes. We show that tumors with transcriptionally inactive HPV16 (DNA+ RNA-) are similar to HPV-negative (DNA-) tumors regarding gene expression and frequency of TP53 mutations (47%, 8/17 and 43%, 72/167, respectively). We also find that an immune response-related gene expression cluster is associated with lymph node metastasis, independent of HPV16 status and that disruptive TP53 mutations are associated with lymph node metastasis in HPV16 DNA- tumors. We validate each of these associations in another large data set. Four gene expression clusters which we identify differ moderately but significantly in overall survival. Our findings underscore the importance of measuring the HPV16 RNA (E6∗I) and TP53-mutation status for patient stratification and identify associations of an immune response-related gene expression cluster and TP53 mutations with lymph node metastasis in HNSCC.},

abstract = {Purpose: Current classification of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) based on anatomic site and stage fails to capture biologic heterogeneity or adequately inform treatment. Experimental Design: Here, we use gene expression-based consensus clustering, copy number profiling, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status on a clinically homogenous cohort of 134 locoregionally advanced HNSCCs with 44% HPV+ tumors together with additional cohorts, which in total comprise 938 tumors, to identify HNSCC subtypes and discover several sub-type-specifi c, translationally relevant characteristics. Results: We identified five subtypes of HNSCC, including two biologically distinct HPV subtypes. One HPV+ and one HPV- subtype show a prominent immune and mesenchymal phenotype. Prominent tumor infiltration with CD8+ lymphocytes characterizes this inflamed/mesenchymal subtype, independent of HPV status. Compared with other subtypes, the two HPV subtypes show low expression and no copy number events for EGFR/HER ligands. In contrast, the basal subtype is uniquely characterized by a prominent EGFR/HER signaling phenotype, negative HPV-status, as well as strong hypoxic differentiation not seen in other subtypes. Conclusion: Our fi ve-subtype classifi cation provides a comprehensive overview of HPV+ as well as HPV- HNSCC biology with significant translational implications for biomarker development and personalized care for patients with HNSCC.

abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a frequently fatal heterogeneous disease. Beyond the role of human papilloma virus (HPV), no validated molecular characterization of the disease has been established. Using an integrated genomic analysis and validation methodology we confirm four molecular classes of HNSCC (basal, mesenchymal, atypical, and classical) consistent with signatures established for squamous carcinoma of the lung, including deregulation of the KEAP1/NFE2L2 oxidative stress pathway, differential utilization of the lineage markers SOX2 and TP63, and preference for the oncogenes PIK3CA and EGFR. For potential clinical use the signatures are complimentary to classification by HPV infection status as well as the putative high risk marker CCND1 copy number gain. A molecular etiology for the subtypes is suggested by statistically significant chromosomal gains and losses and differential cell of origin expression patterns. Model systems representative of each of the four subtypes are also presented. {\textcopyright} 2013 Walter et al.},

abstract = {Purpose: Current assessment of lymph node metastasis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is not accurate enough to prevent overtreatment. The aim of this study was validation of a gene expression signature for distinguishing metastasizing (N+) from nonmetastasizing (N0) squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC) and oropharynx (OPSCC) in a large multicenter cohort, using a diagnostic DNA microarray in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments/International Organization for Standardization-approved laboratory. Methods: A multigene signature, previously reported as predictive for the presence of lymph node metastases in OSCC and OPSCC, was first re-evaluated and trained on 94 samples using generic, whole-genome, DNA microarrays. Signature genes were then transferred to a dedicated diagnostic microarray using the same technology platform. Additional samples (n = 222) were collected from all head and neck oncologic centers in the Netherlands and analyzed with the diagnostic microarray. Human papillomavirus status was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: The negative predictive value (NPV) of the diagnostic signature on the entire validation cohort (n = 222) was 72%. The signature performed well on the most relevant subset of early-stage (cT1-T2N0) OSCC (n = 101), with an NPV of 89%. Conclusion: Combining current clinical assessment with the expression signature would decrease the rate of undetected nodal metastases from 28% to 11% in early-stage OSCC. This should be sufficient to enable clinicians to refrain from elective neck treatment. A new clinical decision model that incorporates the expression signature is therefore proposed for testing in a prospective study, which could substantially improve treatment for this group of patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {The Cancer Genome Atlas profiled 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) to provide a comprehensive landscape of somatic genomic alterations. Here we show that human-papillomavirus-associated tumours are dominated by helical domain mutations of the oncogene PIK3CA, novel alterations involving loss of TRAF3, and amplification of the cell cycle gene E2F1. Smoking-related HNSCCs demonstrate near universal loss-of-function TP53 mutations and CDKN2A inactivation with frequent copy number alterations including amplification of 3q26/28 and 11q13/22. A subgroup of oral cavity tumours with favourable clinical outcomes displayed infrequent copy number alterations in conjunction with activating mutations of HRAS or PIK3CA, coupled with inactivating mutations of CASP8, NOTCH1 and TP53. Other distinct subgroups contained loss-of-function alterations of the chromatin modifier NSD1, WNT pathway genes AJUBA and FAT1, and activation of oxidative stress factor NFE2L2, mainly in laryngeal tumours. Therapeutic candidate alterations were identified in most HNSCCs. The Cancer Genome Atlas presents an integrative genome-wide analysis of genetic alterations in 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), which are classified by human papillomavirus (HPV) status; alterations in EGFR, FGFR, PIK3CA and cyclin-dependent kinases are shown to represent candidate targets for therapeutic intervention in most HNSCCs. Squamous cell head and neck cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers. Despite initial responses to combinations of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, approximately half of all tumours recur, usually within two years of initial diagnosis. Molecular markers and targeted therapies have had little impact on this disease to date. Here, The Cancer Genome Atlas team presents a detailed genome-wide overview of alterations and highlights critical genetic events of potential biological and clinical significance in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) with different human papillomavirus status. Mutational profiles reveal distinct subgroups of HNSCCs. Mutations in EGFR, FGFRs, PIK3CA and cyclin-dependent kinases represent candidate targets for therapeutic intervention in the majority of HNSCCs.},

abstract = {We describe methods with enhanced power and specificity to identify genes targeted by somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) that drive cancer growth. By separating SCNA profiles into underlying arm-level and focal alterations, we improve the estimation of background rates for each category. We additionally describe a probabilistic method for defining the boundaries of selected-for SCNA regions with user-defined confidence. Here we detail this revised computational approach, GISTIC2.0, and validate its performance in real and simulated datasets. {\textcopyright} 2011 Mermel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Benjamin2019,
abstract = {Mutect2 is a somatic variant caller that uses local assembly and realignment to detect SNVs and indels. Assembly implies whole haplotypes and read pairs, rather than single bases, as the atomic units of biological variation and sequencing evidence, improving variant calling. Beyond local assembly and alignment, Mutect2 is based on several probabilistic models for genotyping and filtering that work well with and without a matched normal sample and for all sequencing depths.},
